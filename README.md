## Project Dependencies

<dl>
<dt>Google Apps Script</dt>
<dd>[[Get Started](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/samples)] [CodeLab] [[developer reference](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference)]<br />
**Apps Script** is a cloud-based rapid application development platform a la *JavaScript* that makes it fast and easy to create business applications that automate and integrate with Google Workspace.</dd>

<dt>Google Clasp</dt>
<dd>[[developer guide](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp)] [[GitHub repo](https://github.com/google/clasp?tab=readme-ov-file)]<br />
`clasp` is an open-source command line tool Apps Script projects locally</dd>

<dt>Node.js</dt>
<dd> [[Intro to Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs)] [[developer reference](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/)]<br />
**Node.js** is an open-source and cross-platform *JavaScript runtime environment*.

The `clasp` command-line tool was built in the Node.js runtime environment, so you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer.<br />
ðŸ‘‰ [How to install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)<br />
Node.js comes with a package manger, another command-line utility, **`npm`** (the Node.js package manager). <br />

<dt>TypeScript</dt>
<dd>The `clasp` tool enables these use of TypeScript, which very basically will ultimately enable code sense in various available code editors (i.e. VSCode). But for the brave and ambitiousâ€¦<br />

<h3>Command Line Bonuses</h2>
<p>The perks of moving development to the command line are as infinite as the available open-source code packages. Here are just two command-line-available features this project employs.

<dt>Jest</dt>
<dd>[[Getting Started](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)] [[developer reference](https://jestjs.io/docs/api)]<br />

Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. Testing code when done right offers security. I'm still kind of new to this.</dd>

<dt>Git (and GitHub)</dt>
<dd>[[Git Developer Reference](https://git-scm.com/docs)]<br />

Source control management. **Git** is an open source *distributed version control system* designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. We can track all changes across a team of people on the same project with Git source control.<br />

[[GitHub: Getting Started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)] [[GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en)]<br />
GitHub is a layer on top of Git. GitHub hosts remote repositories, that are easy to access over a network connection.<br />
